# Bell Ringing Ghost in the Box Magic Trick

The magic trick involves the use of a Wemos D1 Mini (Arduino Programmed), a 5V Electromagnet, and a bell to create the illusion of a ghostly presence. The Electromagnet is strategically attached to the underside of the top of the box, in close proximity to the bell (which is hanging just above the Electromagnet), and is controlled by the Wemos D1 Mini through a MOSFET Power Switch (soldered to D1). When triggered, the Electromagnet activates for 1 second, followed by a 0.5-second pause, causing the bell to sway and, consequently, produce the eerie ring.

To control the bell, the Wemos D1 Mini acts as an access point. By connecting to the device and heading to the IP address 192.168.4.1, you gain the ability to control the bell wirelessly, allowing you to turn it on and off remotely. This wireless control enhances the illusion, making it seem as if a ghostly force is responsible for the bell's movement. Its great because in this day and age, a person is always on their phones!!! so its looks more natural than a person holding a random garage remote or something in their hands hahahaha.

One of the spookiest and BEST features of this project is that it's entirely battery-powered, with no external wires coming to or from the box. This adds an extra layer of mystery and allows you to place the haunted box anywhere without the need for visible connections. 

Special thanks to Awais Naeem from embedded-robotics.com for providing the foundation of the code, which was further spookified for this magical Halloween creation by me. 

Perfect for adding an extra layer of spookiness to your Halloween celebrations and other supernatural-themed performances! üéÉüëªüîîüï∏Ô∏èüíÄ## Check out the video for a demonstration
